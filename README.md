Customer Segmentation Analysis
This project involves the application of K-means clustering to perform customer segmentation based on their annual income and spending score. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments that can be targeted for marketing strategies.

Project Overview
Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of marketing strategy, allowing businesses to understand and cater to the needs of different customer groups. In this project, we implemented an unsupervised learning model using K-means clustering to categorize customers into different segments. This analysis helps in identifying target customers, thereby optimizing marketing efforts.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, feature selection, and standardization to prepare the data for clustering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed thorough EDA to understand the data distribution and relationships between different features, which aids in effective clustering.
K-means Clustering: Implemented the K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups based on their annual income and spending score.
Visualization: Visualized the customer segments and other key insights using various plots to facilitate better understanding and communication of results.
Environment
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Missingno, Dabl
Tools: Google Colab
